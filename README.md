# hello-world
This is my first repository, a try according to the tutorial.

The tutorial tells me to write somethig about myself. I'd like to share my motivation for coming here.

As is known to all that github is a good place to learn CS for the beginer and a good place to share ideas, I am going to store some piece of mine for recording my CS learning process. And if any of these can inspire someone of something, I will feel honoured. I think this will be a cloud storage of my back-ups also. An album of programs, which will be meaningful for me some day.
